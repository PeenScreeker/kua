# Folder structure
## cfg
Default configuration files for the mod.

## osdf-ioq3
Contains a modified version of ioquake3 code, to use as a TEMP base for the mod.  

## ./meld
WIP merging folder  
for joining q3a code into ioq3, but without gameplay changes.  
It has Q3A-1.32b code in those places where modifications to gameplay are found.  

ioquake3 team defends that the changes are just bugfixes and don't affect compatibility with original q3a at all.  
Let's assume that is true (for now) and work on this folder when something is not right in the code.   

## condump
For storing important quake console dumps
