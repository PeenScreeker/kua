# Opensource Defrag: Engine
This repository contains only the necessary files for the engine to be compiled, -without- any of its engine dependencies.  

The buildsystem is stored in the root `osdf` repository, inside the folder: `osdf/src/*`
The gamecode files are pulled from the `osdf-game/*` repository.

#### dep folder
Stores deprecated files from the original oDFe repository, before forking.
