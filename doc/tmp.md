# Compile & code:
  - Make gamecode modifications in ioq3
  - Compile with their qvm makefile (root/compile.py will do this)
  - Place the files in a compiled q3e folder to start the mod (root/compile.py will do this)
_This mod makes no modification to the engine itself._  
_It only modifies gamecode._

# ioq3 Gamecode: 
  (supposedly) contains modifications to vanilla gameplay    #TODO: confirm this
  Gamecode Folders: cgame, game, q3_ui

# q3e engine:
  ?? no modifications needed (in theory)
