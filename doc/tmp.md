# Compile & code:
  - Make gamecode modifications in ioq3  
  - Compile with their qvm makefile (root/compile.py will do this)  
  - Place the files in a compiled q3e folder to start the mod (root/compile.py will do this)  
_This mod makes no modification to the engine itself._  
_It only modifies gamecode._  

# Gamecode (ioq3/q3a): 
  Gamecode Folders: cgame, game, q3_ui  
  ioq3 (supposedly) contains modifications to vanilla gameplay    #TODO: confirm this  

# q3e engine:
  ?? no modifications needed (in theory)  

## Rewrite or Reverse engineer?
